    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Includes and Definitions**:\n",
    "   - `manif/SE2.h`: This includes functions and structures from the `manif` library for SE(2) Lie group operations.\n",
    "   - The `Array2d` and `Array3d` types define vectors in 2D and 3D, which are used for control and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - **Robot Pose and Covariance**:\n",
    "     - `manif::SE2d X, X_simulation, X_unfiltered;`: These represent the robot's pose (position and orientation) in the `SE(2)` group.\n",
    "     - `Matrix3d P;`: This is the covariance matrix of the robot pose, initialized to zero.\n",
    "   - **Control and Noise**:\n",
    "     - `u_nom`: The nominal control, representing `(v * dt, 0, w * dt)`.\n",
    "     - `u_sigmas`: Control noise standard deviations in each direction `(v, s, w)`.\n",
    "     - `U`: The control noise covariance matrix.\n",
    "   - **Landmarks**:\n",
    "     - Three 2D landmarks are defined in the world frame with coordinates `b0`, `b1`, and `b2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Loop**:\n",
    "   - The loop runs for 10 time steps, simulating motion, measurement, estimation, and comparison between the simulated, estimated, and unfiltered states.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I. Simulation Step\n",
    "   - **Control Noise**:\n",
    "     - `u_noise` is a random Gaussian noise vector with the specified standard deviations in `u_sigmas`.\n",
    "     - `u_noisy` is the nominal control plus this noise.\n",
    "   - **Pose Update**:\n",
    "     - `X_simulation = X_simulation + u_simu;`: Updates the simulated robot pose. `+` here represents `SE(2)` addition using `X.rplus(u) = X * exp(u)`.\n",
    "   - **Landmark Measurement**:\n",
    "     - For each landmark, the code calculates the expected measurement (`y = X_simulation.inverse().act(b);`) in the robot frame.\n",
    "     - Noise is added to each measurement `y`, simulating sensor noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. Estimation Step\n",
    "   - **Control Update**:\n",
    "     - `X = X.plus(u_est, J_x, J_u);`: Updates the estimated pose using the noisy control `u_est`, with Jacobians `J_x` and `J_u` for the state and control.\n",
    "     - **Covariance Update**:\n",
    "       - `P = J_x * P * J_x.transpose() + J_u * U * J_u.transpose();`: Updates the pose covariance matrix with the propagated uncertainty from the control noise.\n",
    "   - **Measurement Update**:\n",
    "     - For each measured landmark:\n",
    "       - `e = X.inverse(J_xi_x).act(b, J_e_xi);`: Calculates the expected position of the landmark in the robot frame.\n",
    "       - `z = y - e;`: Computes the innovation (difference) between the observed and expected measurement.\n",
    "       - **Kalman Gain**:\n",
    "         - `K = P * H.transpose() * Z.inverse();`: Calculates the Kalman gain, which determines how much to adjust the estimate based on the measurement.\n",
    "       - **Correction**:\n",
    "         - `dx = K * z;`: Calculates the correction in the tangent space.\n",
    "         - `X = X + dx;`: Updates the estimated pose by adding the correction.\n",
    "         - `P = P - K * Z * K.transpose();`: Updates the covariance matrix by incorporating measurement information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### III. Unfiltered Update\n",
    "   - The code also keeps an \"unfiltered\" version of the state (`X_unfiltered`) updated only by the control signal, without applying any corrections from measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IV. Output Results\n",
    "   - After each step, the code prints the `X_simulation`, `X`, and `X_unfiltered` states, allowing for comparison between the simulated, estimated, and unfiltered states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This code uses a Lie-based error-state Kalman filter to estimate the robot's pose over time, accounting for control and measurement noise. Each control update modifies the robot's state with uncertainty propagation, and each measurement update corrects the estimate using the Kalman filter. The debug output enables tracking of the simulated, estimated, and unfiltered states to evaluate estimation accuracy."
