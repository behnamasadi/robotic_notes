    "In a standard incremental SfM pipeline that uses something like the Snavely/BAL (Bundle Adjustment in the Large) reprojection model, *all cameras* and *all 3D points* should typically be expressed in a common “world” coordinate system (often chosen to be the first camera).  Whenever you add a new camera (e.g., camera 3) and triangulate new points in that camera’s local frame, you should transform both the camera’s pose and the newly triangulated points into the common reference frame before adding them to the bundle adjuster.\n",

    "p[1] += camera[4];\n",
    "p[2] += camera[5];\n",

    "Here,\n",
    "- `camera[0..2]` is an angle-axis rotation (which represents $R$).\n",
    "- `camera[3..5]` is a translation vector (which represents $\\mathbf{t}$).\n",
    "- `camera[6]` is the focal length, and `camera[7..8]` are radial distortion coefficients.\n",

    "   Once you have the newly triangulated points in the world (camera 1) coordinates, you can add them (and camera 3’s pose in world coords) into your bundle adjuster. During bundle adjustment:\n",
    "   - Each 3D point is stored in world coords,\n",
    "   - Each camera has extrinsics that transform a world point $\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{w}$ into that camera’s local frame,\n",

    "Thus, **yes**—if your triangulation code yields points in camera 2’s reference frame, and you want them in camera 1’s (world) frame, you use the **inverse** of the “camera 1 to camera 2” transform."
