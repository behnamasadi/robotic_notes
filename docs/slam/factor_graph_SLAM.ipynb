    "Graph Pose SLAM and Factor Graph SLAM are closely related, as both are used for solving SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problems using graph-based optimization. However, they differ in their conceptual modeling, mathematical formulation, and representation of the problem. Here's a detailed comparison:\n",

    "### 1. **Graph Pose SLAM**\n",
    "Graph Pose SLAM is a traditional graph-based approach where:\n",
    "- **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent robot poses ($ \\textbf{X}_i = (x_i, y_i, \\theta_i) $) in the trajectory or landmarks in the environment.\n",
    "- **Edges:** Represent spatial constraints between nodes, which are derived from odometry or sensor measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Structure:**\n",
    "   - A pose graph connects robot poses with odometry constraints (between consecutive poses) and loop-closure constraints (from sensor observations).\n",
    "   - The optimization minimizes the error between the predicted and measured transformations (relative pose constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Formulation:**\n",
    "   - Each edge $e_{ij}$ corresponds to the error between:\n",
    "     - $z_{ij}$: The observed relative transformation between $ \\textbf{X}_i $ and $ \\textbf{X}_j $.\n",
    "     - $h(\\textbf{X}_i, \\textbf{X}_j)$: The predicted relative transformation based on current pose estimates.\n",
    "   - The optimization minimizes the total error:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     E = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{ij} e_{ij}^T \\Omega_{ij} e_{ij}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - Here, $ \\Omega_{ij} $ is the information matrix (inverse of the measurement covariance).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Application:**\n",
    "   - Primarily used for solving pose graph SLAM problems, where the robot's trajectory is optimized given odometry and sensor constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example:**\n",
    "   - In Graph Pose SLAM, the problem is solved iteratively using approaches like Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt, where $H$ and $b$ (information matrix and residual vector) are constructed from the graph.\n",

    "### 2. **Factor Graph SLAM**\n",
    "Factor Graph SLAM is a more general framework derived from probabilistic graphical models. It represents the SLAM problem as a **factor graph**:\n",
    "- **Variables (Nodes):** Represent unknowns to be estimated, including robot poses ($ \\textbf{X}_i $) and possibly landmarks ($ \\textbf{L}_j $).\n",
    "- **Factors:** Represent probabilistic constraints or measurements relating variables (e.g., odometry, sensor data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Structure:**\n",
    "   - A factor graph explicitly separates variables and factors:\n",
    "     - Variables ($ \\textbf{X}_i, \\textbf{L}_j $): Robot poses and landmarks.\n",
    "     - Factors ($ f $): Constraints or measurements, such as odometry ($f_\\text{odom}$) or observations ($f_\\text{obs}$).\n",
    "   - Each factor connects one or more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Formulation:**\n",
    "   - Factor graph SLAM minimizes the negative log of the joint probability of all variables given the measurements:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{X}, \\mathbb{L} \\mid \\mathbb{Z}) \\propto \\prod_k f_k(\\mathbb{X}, \\mathbb{L}, \\mathbb{Z})\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - The negative log transforms this into a sum of squared errors:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\mathcal{E} = \\sum_k \\| e_k(\\mathbb{X}, \\mathbb{L}) \\|^2\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - Each factor contributes an error term $e_k$, depending on the associated measurement and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generalization:**\n",
    "   - Factor graphs are more general and can handle a variety of problems, including SLAM with landmarks, multi-robot SLAM, and sensor fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example:**\n",
    "   - A factor connecting $ \\textbf{X}_i $ and $ \\textbf{X}_j $ via odometry $z_{ij}$:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     f_\\text{odom}(\\textbf{X}_i, \\textbf{X}_j) = \\exp\\left(-\\| z_{ij} - h(\\textbf{X}_i, \\textbf{X}_j) \\|^2_{\\Omega_{ij}} \\right)\n",
