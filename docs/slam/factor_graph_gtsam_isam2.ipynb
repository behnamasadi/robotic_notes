    "- **Edges:** Represent spatial constraints between nodes, which are derived from odometry or sensor measurements.\n",

    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Structure:**\n",
    "   - A pose graph connects robot poses with odometry constraints (between consecutive poses) and loop-closure constraints (from sensor observations).\n",
    "   - The optimization minimizes the error between the predicted and measured transformations (relative pose constraints).\n",
