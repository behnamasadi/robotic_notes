    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Includes and Definitions**:\n",
    "   - `manif/SE2.h`: This includes functions and structures from the `manif` library for SE(2) Lie group operations.\n",
    "   - The `Array2d` and `Array3d` types define vectors in 2D and 3D, which are used for control and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - **Robot Pose and Covariance**:\n",
    "     - `manif::SE2d X, X_simulation, X_unfiltered;`: These represent the robot's pose (position and orientation) in the `SE(2)` group.\n",
    "     - `Matrix3d P;`: This is the covariance matrix of the robot pose, initialized to zero.\n",
    "   - **Control and Noise**:\n",
    "     - `u_nom`: The nominal control, representing `(v * dt, 0, w * dt)`.\n",
    "     - `u_sigmas`: Control noise standard deviations in each direction `(v, s, w)`.\n",
    "     - `U`: The control noise covariance matrix.\n",
    "   - **Landmarks**:\n",
    "     - Three 2D landmarks are defined in the world frame with coordinates `b0`, `b1`, and `b2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Loop**:\n",
    "   - The loop runs for 10 time steps, simulating motion, measurement, estimation, and comparison between the simulated, estimated, and unfiltered states.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I. Simulation Step\n",
    "   - **Control Noise**:\n",
    "     - `u_noise` is a random Gaussian noise vector with the specified standard deviations in `u_sigmas`.\n",
    "     - `u_noisy` is the nominal control plus this noise.\n",
    "   - **Pose Update**:\n",
    "     - `X_simulation = X_simulation + u_simu;`: Updates the simulated robot pose. `+` here represents `SE(2)` addition using `X.rplus(u) = X * exp(u)`.\n",
    "   - **Landmark Measurement**:\n",
    "     - For each landmark, the code calculates the expected measurement (`y = X_simulation.inverse().act(b);`) in the robot frame.\n",
    "     - Noise is added to each measurement `y`, simulating sensor noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. Estimation Step\n",
    "   - **Control Update**:\n",
    "     - `X = X.plus(u_est, J_x, J_u);`: Updates the estimated pose using the noisy control `u_est`, with Jacobians `J_x` and `J_u` for the state and control.\n",
    "     - **Covariance Update**:\n",
    "       - `P = J_x * P * J_x.transpose() + J_u * U * J_u.transpose();`: Updates the pose covariance matrix with the propagated uncertainty from the control noise.\n",
    "   - **Measurement Update**:\n",
    "     - For each measured landmark:\n",
    "       - `e = X.inverse(J_xi_x).act(b, J_e_xi);`: Calculates the expected position of the landmark in the robot frame.\n",
    "       - `z = y - e;`: Computes the innovation (difference) between the observed and expected measurement.\n",
    "       - **Kalman Gain**:\n",
    "         - `K = P * H.transpose() * Z.inverse();`: Calculates the Kalman gain, which determines how much to adjust the estimate based on the measurement.\n",
    "       - **Correction**:\n",
    "         - `dx = K * z;`: Calculates the correction in the tangent space.\n",
    "         - `X = X + dx;`: Updates the estimated pose by adding the correction.\n",
    "         - `P = P - K * Z * K.transpose();`: Updates the covariance matrix by incorporating measurement information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### III. Unfiltered Update\n",
    "   - The code also keeps an \"unfiltered\" version of the state (`X_unfiltered`) updated only by the control signal, without applying any corrections from measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IV. Output Results\n",
    "   - After each step, the code prints the `X_simulation`, `X`, and `X_unfiltered` states, allowing for comparison between the simulated, estimated, and unfiltered states.\n",
